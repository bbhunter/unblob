1.   unblob is easily extensible, and you can write your own handler and include your own extractors for proprietary formats.
     To learn more about this, see the [development section](development.md).
     Alternatively, just open a [new ticket](https://github.com/onekey-sec/unblob/issues) in the Github issue tracker.

     Whenever we stumble upon proprietary formats in our ONEKEY analysis platform, we will add support for it.
     At this point, we have developed about a dozen of additional, proprietary format Handlers.

     If you are interested in a custom format not supported by the open source version, check out our platform at
     [https://www.onekey.com](https://www.onekey.com) or you can [Contact Us](support.md).
